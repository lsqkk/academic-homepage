## About Me

I am Zhu Enze(朱恩泽), a 2025 undergraduate student in the School of **Automation** at Xi'an Jiaotong University(西安交通大学) and a member of the 2023 class of the **Young Gifted Program (YGP, 少年班)**. My focus lies at the intersection of intelligent systems and software engineering, with a proven ability to solve practical problems through independent development and project implementation. My interests span machine learning, embedded systems, and full-stack application development.

## **Education**

### Xi'an Jiaotong University

- **Bachelor of Engineering (in progress) - Automation** | Sept. 2025 - Present
  Core Courses: Programming (C Language), Principles of Automatic Control, etc.
- **Young Gifted Program Phase (Preparatory)** | Sept. 2023 - Jun. 2025
  Completed undergraduate prerequisite coursework ahead of schedule and initiated early training in engineering practice and scientific research. Independently developed and maintained a personal technical blog, created applications using low-code platforms, and obtained multiple software copyrights. Participated in and received awards in several academic competitions.

## **Project Experience**

### CNN-based Animal Recognition System (YGP Preparatory AI Course Project)

- Responsible for dataset downloading, preprocessing, and final reporting. The innovation lies in training the CNN from scratch without freezing earlier layers, along with introducing improvements in pooling strategies and cosine annealing scheduling to enhance convergence and accuracy.
- Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV.
- Outcome: Course project submitted with full pipeline documentation and performance analysis.

### U-Transformer Architecture for Meteorological Prediction (YGP Preparatory AI Course Project)

- Contributed to partial code development for a weather forecasting model based on a U-Transformer structure. The design integrates strengths from both [Pangu](https://pangu.huaweicloud.com/gallery/solutions/industry/weather.html) and [Fuxi](https://github.com/tpys/FuXi) large weather models, implemented using the domestic PaddlePaddle deep learning framework to support efficient spatial-temporal prediction.
- Tech Stack: Python, PaddlePaddle, NumPy.
- Outcome: Functional prototype for multi-step meteorological variable forecasting.

### Cross-Platform PPT Remote Control Tool (Open Source Project)

- Designed and implemented a lightweight remote control solution based on web and local bridge programs. Utilized Firebase for real-time signaling synchronization and employed a local Node.js script to parse commands and simulate keyboard events, enabling seamless control of PC-side PPT presentations from a mobile device.
- Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node.js, Firebase Realtime Database.

### Serverless P2P File Transfer System (Personal Blog Service)

- To overcome the limitation of lacking a dedicated signaling server, I established a signaling channel using Firebase Realtime Database. Combined with WebRTC technology and public STUN servers, this system enabled direct peer-to-peer file transfer between browsers.
- Tech Stack: JavaScript (WebRTC API), Firebase.

### AI-Based Forest Fire Prediction Model (AIC Competition)

- Responsible for the multimodal data preprocessing pipeline, specifically handling the download, cleaning, and spatial interpolation of ERA5 reanalysis meteorological data to provide structured input for subsequent CNN and large language model training, and made innovations based on the [YingLong Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11029). The project won a provincial third prize.
- Tech Stack: Python, PaddlePaddle.

### Personal Server Deployment and Operation

- Deployed and maintained a home server cluster on [Orange Pi](http://www.orangepi.cn/), stably running various services including Ollama (local large language model service), Nextcloud (private cloud storage), WordPress (website management), etc. Gained practical experience in Linux system administration, containerized application deployment, and intranet penetration techniques.

### Personal Independent Blog Development

- Designed, developed from scratch, and continuously maintain a static blog system for sharing technical notes and project summaries. The system achieves zero server backend deployment, with all code open-sourced. The site has obtained a software copyright.

## **Competitions & Awards**

- **Mathematical Contest in Modeling / Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), 2025** – Honorable Mention. Responsible for mathematical model construction, paper writing, and data visualization.
- **China Undergraduate Physics Experiment Competition, 2025** – National First Prize (First Place in the Northwestern Division). Responsible for animation simulation and video production of core experimental phenomena.
- **Global Campus Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Elite Competition (AIC)** – Provincial Third Prize. Responsible for downloading, preprocessing, cleaning, and spatial interpolation of multimodal meteorological data.
- **Xi'an Jiaotong University School-Level Scholarship, 2025**

## **Technical Skills**

- **Programming Languages**: Python (data processing & machine learning), C/C++ (fundamental development), JavaScript/HTML/CSS (front-end development), Bash (Linux operations).
- **Frameworks & Tools**: TensorFlow/PyTorch, PaddlePaddle, Linux, Git, Firebase, LaTeX.
- **Hardware & Platforms**: Familiar with Arduino development fundamentals, experienced in deploying platforms like Orange Pi.
- **Languages**: Chinese (Native), English (CET-6, proficient in reading academic literature).
